C++ Quaternion and matrix library - Allows gimbal-lock free flight sim

# Brief
This library provides 3x3 and 4x4 matrices, 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and Quaternions in C++. Hot feature includes generation of rotation matrices and quaternions, as well as conversions of matrices and quaternions back to Euler angle form (yaw, pitch, roll). The usage is demonstrated in a haphazard OpenGL program in which you fly through a skybox.
